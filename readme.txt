== Description ==
Everything on WordPress depends on the action and filter hooks. And they are the backbone of WordPress. You can enhance or customize any WordPress functionality by using these hooks. If you look at any WordPress page or post, they appear through the combination of action & filter hooks.

If you want to customize any functionality, whether it comes from a theme or plugin, you can customize it using their action and filter hooks without touching the core files. But sometimes, it is really hard to find what action or filter hooks you have to use to customize the functionality according to the need.

This plugin will solve your problem and display all the action and filter hooks of any page, post, widget header, footer, or anything appearing on your screen. So you can easily find what action and filter you have to use to add or customize the functionality.

Once you have installed the plugin, a menu "Hooks Finder" will appear on top of the admin bar. You can view all the action and filter hooks that are running on your WordPress page, including header, footer, widgets, etc.
